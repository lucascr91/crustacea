# The Wall

In one of my many conversations on race with my friends – whose overwhelming majority is white as I have been attending middle-class environments since I was 17 –, a friend says he doesn't like the victimization which, according to him, is very characteristic of middle-class blacks. After I had asked him to better develop the idea of victimization, which is not a concept strange to me as I had used it in the past but it's undoubtedly ill-defined, he gave an example of the only environment he deals with lower-class blacks: football. Every Saturday or so he meets a set of friends and plays soccer, as the game goes on there are usual insults which, invariably, include swearings with racial overtones. According to my friend, the racial swearings go in either direction, that is, both blacks and whites used it against each other. Hence a black man who was called a "macaco" can have his verbal vengeance calling a white fellow a "branquelo". Instead of complaining, they react. Middle-class blacks, in turn, always denounce racial swearings as injustice. This reveals their intention of not playing by the game's rules which, I suppose,  is a signal of weakness.

The standard answer for this line of reasoning, drawn from Marxists and Freudian insights, has the following form. As groups, black and white Brazilians differ widely regarding the possession of capital, human and physical. This inequality in capital causes blacks to occupy inferior positions in production. As one should expect, the lower wages and second-rate occupations have implications for the entire social organization, and this explains why blacks are always represented as inferior in religion (remember, Jesus is not black and angels are white as hell), art, and culture in general. 

Better than description is an example. Here a folkloric song common in capoeira circles in the 1920s:

“O negro é burro de carga 
O branco é inteligente 
O branco só não trabalha 
Porque preto não é gente.” 

“Quem diz que preto se cansa 
Não tem boa opinião 
Se trabalha o dia inteiro 
De noite inda faz serão.”

The cultural standards produced by this perverse logic are not unrelated to our existence as subjects. Some have argued that all of us have some kind of ideal ego, a being that is a projection of ourselves in the future that we strive every day to become. This ideal ego, however, is just a person build according to the "image and likeness" of our culturally-made values.  As noted by Neusa Santos, the implication of this psychological model for the racial question in Brazil is that every black person has a white being as the ideal ego. One of the most moving examples showed by Santos in his classical book is the story of a black woman who gradually develops a rejection for her own body, as time passed by this rejection grows in strength and she becomes even unable to face the mirror.

This example is very telling because the contradiction that black Brazilians face through life is made patently clear here. Since the standards praised by our society are eminently white, one can meet the exigencies made by the ideal ego only if she is white. One way to measure self-esteem is the distance between the ideal ego and the actual person. Consequently, if a black person doesn't manage to somewhat change her ideal ego, she will be stuck into a sisyphusian trap, which is usually an experience filled with self-hate and self-depreciative jokes. The path out of melancholy and self-hate necessarily involves a change in these standards, which might only become possible through a permanent struggle against all messages one receives daily through TV, ordinary conversations, relatives' expectations, and so on.

To finally answer the question that opened this essay, "macaco" might be somewhat imagined as just compensation for "branquelo", but they hardly have the same social meaning. While one adjective has the function of reinforces a system of oppression, the other is a petty and impotent reaction to this oppression.

And I mean impotent. Although I would not repress someone who is fighting to change her ideal ego, I believe that no individual action can by itself alone change the cultural environment where we live in. Actually, the problem is deeper than that. The problem is not so much that oppressive standards are well and alive in an individual's social milieu: school, university, workplace, or church. The problem is that these standards are well and alive in one very heart and mind. If one grows up watching TV shows that praise the beauty of white women and, not surprisingly, becomes an adult with a clear sexual preference for white women, is it possible to change this preference in adulthood? Can you free yourself from that weird feeling, while in white middle-class environments, of not belonging?

Individually, overcome the racial cleavage present in the ideal ego is impossible as the ideal ego was itself socially built and only the change in our collective memory and imaginary can transform it. Can this collective imaginary change in one's lifetime? I don't think so.
